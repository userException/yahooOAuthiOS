# yahooOAuthiOS
An illustration of OAuth Signature call for Yahoo Weather written in Swift and Objective-C.

![](sample.gif)

The [example code](https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/documentation.html#code-example) given by yahoo is written in Java, PHP and Node.js. If you need to port it in Swift/Objective-C you can use this instead to save some time and have a beer :). For this example, I have used Miami Beach's location coordinates to fetch the current weather codnitions there. 

Do remember to create your own credentials from Yahoo's ["Create App"](https://developer.yahoo.com/apps/create/) page as this is an open source project and anyone could be using these keys.
